# Change log
- v1.0.4
	- Pushed v1.0.3 and synced with npm (so ready to follow the new workflow documented here: `/Users/lamba/Dropbox/my-docs/md-notes/tech/js/js-notes.pdf`)
	- Added y-axis ticks and tick labels
	- Centralized management of chart margins
	- Fixed "Selected Columns:" UI and moved it to the top so it's not obstructed by the brush bar
	- Fixed footer for Inventica Consulting
	- Defined x-axis labels and moved them out of the chart area so that they don't conflict the the brush bar which moves around as it displays its own labels
